* [Crate](https://crates.io/crates/graphalgs)


## Description

<p>Graph algorithms based on the Rust "petgraph" library.</p>

## Relevance

```petgraph``` is a great tool for working with graphs in ```Rust```, but not all algorithms make sense to put there, so the ```graphalgs``` library will be a repository for a variety of algorithms implemented on the basis of ```petgraph```.</p>

## Stage of development

<p>This is a pre-alpha stage of development, published mainly to take a name on crates.io. All code changes will occur on github without updating the crate until the product is ready to release the alpha version.</p>

## Usage

As a library
```rust
extern crate graphalgs;

```
