## Description

<p>Graph algorithms based on the Rust "petgraph" library.</p>

## Relevance

```petgraph``` is a great tool for working with graphs in ```Rust```, but not all algorithms make sense to put there, so the ```graphalgs``` library will be a repository for a variety of algorithms implemented on the basis of ```petgraph```.</p>

## Stage of development

<p>Version 0.0.3 is the first release of the library already with a decent number of algorithms. At this stage of development, it is especially important for us to have feedback to resolve possible misunderstandings in terms of or to improve existing implementations of algorithms in order to develop a stable library style.</p>

## Usage

As a library
```rust
extern crate graphalgs;

```
